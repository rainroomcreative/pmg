                            <p>For these pages I trust your judgment on the design they just need to be able to handle large amounts of text and be responsive. I would just have that white background with that piece of my logo you use for the background like on the homepage and have my logo at the top.
    The content for now can just be text placeholders. Iâ€™ll put that in.</p>
